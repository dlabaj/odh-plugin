  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start details how to develop using the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit.

    The Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit) gives data scientists, AI developers, and researchers familiar Python tools and frameworks to accelerate end-to-end data science and machine learning pipelines on Intel® architectures.

    The components are built using oneAPI libraries for low-level compute optimizations.

    This toolkit maximizes performance from preprocessing through machine and deep learning phases and provides interoperability for efficient model development and deployment across single and multinode environments.

    This quick start covers how to run a data science notebook sample with Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit optimizations. It also walks you through how to load your own notebook with Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit drop-in accelerations for your own workloads or tasks.

        ### Administrator steps
        #### This is only required the first time
        1. Install the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit Operator if it's not installed
        2. Change namespace to redhat-ods-applications
        3. Select the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit Operator. This can be found in the UI under Operators > Installed Operators > Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit Operator
        4. Go to the "AIKitContainer" tab
        5. Click create
        6. The AIKit Notebook ImageStream will be created.

        ### Important considerations
        Use the **Intel oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit** notebook with the **Large** container size.

        This triggers pulling the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit container. Once the pulling is complete, you are presented with a JupyterHub notebook environment.

      description: |-
        ### Loading a Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit sample notebook
        1. Click on the `oneAPI-samples.git` directory. As part of the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit on Red Hat OpenShift Data Science, we have provided you three examples to help you get started with different AI Kit optimizations.
        2. Click on the `E2E_use_case_with_Intel_optimized_XGBoost_daal4py` directory, then click on the `IntelPython_XGBoost_daal4pyPrediction.ipynb` notebook.
        3. Choose the `Intel SKLearn, XGBoost, & Modin`  JupyterHub Kernel Environment to launch the notebook in.

        ### Running an Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit sample
        1. Run the `IntelPython_XGBoost_daal4pyPrediction.ipynb` notebook cell by cell, taking care not to skip any steps. Once you have completed the entire notebook, you will have learned about some AI Kit optimizations and fundamentals.
        2. (Optional) You can proceed with this step and the previous step with any of the either samples in the correct AI Kit JupyterHub Kernel environment to learn more about other AI Kit optimizations. Use the `Intel SKLearn, XGBoost, & Modin` JupyterHub Kernel Environment for the `IntelPython_XGBoost_daal4pyPrediction.ipynb` notebook example, and the `Intel TensorFlow & Quantization` JupyterHub Kernel Environment for the `lpot_sample_tensorflow.ipynb` notebook example.
