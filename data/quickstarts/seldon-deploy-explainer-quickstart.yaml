  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows you how to launch an income classifier model and see explanations.
    Seldon Deploy is a specialist set of tools designed to simplify and accelerate the process of deploying and managing your machine learning models.

    This quick start is a short version of the Seldon [Model Explanations with Anchor Tabular](https://deploy.seldon.io/en/v1.2/contents/demos/seldon-core/explainer-anchor-tabular/index.html) tutorial.

        ### Deploy a pretrained income classifier model
        1. Open Seldon Console and click **Create** to open the deployment creation wizard.
        2. Select the **SeldonDeployment** type and click **Next**.
        3. Choose the **scikit-learn** runtime. Enter the model URL: `gs://seldon-models/sklearn/income/model-0.23.2`
        4. Click through the wizard to deploy the model.
      summary:
        success: You have deployed a pretrained SKLearn iris model
        failed: Try the steps again or see the Seldon [Model Explanations with Anchor Tabular](https://deploy.seldon.io/en/v1.2/contents/demos/seldon-core/explainer-anchor-tabular/index.html) tutorial.
    - title: Add an explainer
      description: |-
        ### Deploy a pretrained explainer model for the income classifier
        1. From the income classifier model's page, under **Alibi**, click **Configure**.
        2. Use the default options to create an anchor tabular explainer. Enter this Explainer URI when prompted: `gs://seldon-models/sklearn/income/explainer-py36-0.5.2`
        3. Click through wizard to deploy the explainer.
      summary:
        success: The explainer shows as loaded
        failed: Try the steps again or see the Seldon [Model Explanations with Anchor Tabular](https://deploy.seldon.io/en/v1.2/contents/demos/seldon-core/explainer-anchor-tabular/index.html) tutorial.
    - title: Make a prediction and see explanations
      description: |-
        ### Make a prediction:
        1. Use the following request payload to make a prediction:
          ```
          {"data": {"names": ["Age","Workclass","Education","Marital Status","Occupation","Relationship","Race","Sex","Capital Gain","Capital Loss","Hours per week","Country"], "ndarray": [[53,4,0,2,8,4,2,0,0,0,60,9]]}}
          ```
        2. You should get a successful result back from the prediction.
        3. Click **Explain** under the prediction to understand the most influential features in calculating this result.
      summary:
        success: You see anchor-style explanations for the income classifier model.
        failed: Try the steps again or see the Seldon [Model Explanations with Anchor Tabular](https://deploy.seldon.io/en/v1.2/contents/demos/seldon-core/explainer-anchor-tabular/index.html) tutorial.
  conclusion: You are now able to understand the predictions of the model.
